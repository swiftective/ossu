; PROBLEM:
;
; Use the built in version of filter to design a function called wide-only
; that consumes a list of images and produces a list containing only those
; images that are wider than they are tall.

(check-expect (wide-only (list I1 I2 I3 I4 I5)) (list I2 I4))

(define (wide-only loi)
  (filter
    (Î» (i) (> (image-width i) (image-height i)))
